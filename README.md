# ‚òïTHE GITPOT APP‚òï
## Description
The GitPot application is a free-to-use website designed to help its users publicize their wanted gifts. GitPot can be used to create a wishlist of items that you would like to receive as gifts. Your friends can then view this wishlist on the website and have options to give you the gift you want. This approach is a great way to ensure that you receive gifts that you actually want and need. It also makes it easier for your friends to choose a gift for you, as they can see exactly what you are looking for.
