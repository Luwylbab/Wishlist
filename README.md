# ‚òïTHE GiftPot APP‚òï
## Project 2
## Description
The GiftPot application is a free-to-use website designed to help its users publicize their wanted gifts. GiftPot can be used to create a wishlist of items that you would like to receive as gifts. Your friends can then view this wishlist on the website and have options to give you the gift you want. This approach is a great way to ensure that you receive gifts that you actually want and need. It also makes it easier for your friends to choose a gift for you, as they can see exactly what you are looking for.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
