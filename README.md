# ‚òïTHE GITPOT APP‚òï
## Project 2
## Description
The GitPot application is a free-to-use website designed to help its users publicize their wanted gifts. GitPot can be used to create a wishlist of items that you would like to receive as gifts. Your friends can then view this wishlist on the website and have options to give you the gift you want. This approach is a great way to ensure that you receive gifts that you actually want and need. It also makes it easier for your friends to choose a gift for you, as they can see exactly what you are looking for.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

# 15 Project 2: Interactive Full-Stack Application

Projects play a key role in your journey to becoming a full-stack web developer. As you enter the last phase of the boot camp, you‚Äôll begin to apply for development jobs. If you want to land interviews, your portfolio must feature high-quality deployed examples of your work‚Äî-and you can use your finished projects for that very purpose.

As your first opportunity to show employers your collaborative skills and coding abilities, this particular project will be a focal point of your portfolio. Employers want to see what you can do, but they also want to see how you work with other developers. The more examples of deployed collaborative work you have in your portfolio, the more likely you are to get an interview and a job.

## Project Requirements

You and your group will use everything you‚Äôve learned over the past six modules to create a real-world full-stack application that you‚Äôll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfil the following requirements:

* Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.

* Use Handlebars.js as the template engine.

* Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.

* Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

* Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we haven‚Äôt discussed.

* Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.

* Include authentication (express-session and cookies).

* Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.

* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

* Have a polished UI.

* Be responsive.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Meet good-quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a professional README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Presentation Requirements

Use this [project presentation template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10QaO9KH8HtUXj__81ve0SZcpO5DbMbqqQr4iPpbwKks/edit?usp=sharing) to address the following: 

* Elevator pitch: a one minute description of your application

* Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?

* Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?

* Demo: Show your stuff!

* Directions for Future Development

* Links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository. Use the [Guide to Deploy with Heroku and MySQL](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/heroku/deploy-with-heroku-and-mysql) on The Full-Stack Blog if you need a reminder on how to deploy to Heroku.
